ðŸŽ® FinSurf â€“ A Fish Surfing Game
FinSurf is a fun and lightweight Android game where a fish surfs through the water, collecting points and dodging hazards! Built entirely using Jetpack Compose and Material 3, this game demonstrates a smooth UI, state management, score tracking, and an intuitive navigation flow.

âœ¨ Features
Simple Controls: Intuitively guide the fish through the water with simple tap or drag gestures.

Dynamic Scoring:

ðŸŸ¢ Green Dots: +25 points

ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Dots: +10 points

ðŸ”´ Red Dots: -20 points

Life System: Start with 3 lives. Colliding with a red dot costs one life. The game ends when all lives are lost.

Persistent High Score: The app saves your highest score locally, giving you a record to beat every time you play.

Seamless Navigation: On game over, a Khel Khatam! toast message appears, and the app automatically navigates to a score screen showing your final score alongside the high score.

Play Again: A "Play Again" button on the score screen lets you jump right back into a new game.
